# AI Coach: Your Personal Fitness Trainer
## Overview

AI Coach is a cutting-edge fitness application that leverages the power of artificial intelligence and your smartphone's camera to track and count body movements such as push-ups, curls, and squats. Whether you're a fitness enthusiast or just starting your fitness journey, AI Coach is designed to help you achieve your goals with real-time feedback and personalized coaching.

## Features
- **Real-Time Movement Tracking**: Uses your phone's camera to accurately track and count repetitions of various exercises.
- **Exercise Variety**: Supports multiple exercises including push-ups, bicep curls, squats, and more.
- **Form Correction**: Provides real-time feedback on your form to help you perform exercises correctly and avoid injuries.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate interface designed for a seamless user experience.

## How It Works
1. **Setup**: Place your phone in a stable position where the camera has a clear view of your workout area.
2. **Select Exercise**: Choose the exercise you want to perform from the app's menu.
3. **Start Workout**: Begin your exercise, and AI Coach will start tracking your movements.
4. **Receive Feedback**: Get real-time feedback on your form and repetition count.

### Human Pose Estimation
Human pose estimation involves detecting and localizing major body joints to understand the body's posture and movement. In AI Coach, this technology is powered by **OpenCV** and deep learning models. Here's how it works:
1. **Input**: The app captures video frames from your smartphone's camera.
2. **Detection**: A pre-trained deep learning model detects key body joints and creates a skeletal representation of your body.
3. **Tracking**: The app tracks the movement of these joints over time to count repetitions and analyze your form.
4. **Feedback**: Real-time feedback is provided to help you correct your posture and improve your performance.
